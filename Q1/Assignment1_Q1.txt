initialize array L1[N1] = {1,3,5,7,9};
initialize array L2[N2] = {2,4,6,8,10};

initialize intersectionList[N1 + N2];

for loop starts at 0 as long as starting target is less than the length of intersectionList add 1 to starting targer:
	if starting target > N1:
		append the remaining of L2 onto the end of intersectionList
	else:
		if (L1[startingTarget] < startingTarget[startingTarget])
			append to the intersectionList the L1[startingTarget]
		else:
			append to the intersectionList the L2[startingTarget]

Running time complexity if both N_2 and N_1 were the same size would be O(n) assuming N_2 > N_1
The running time complexity is O(N + (N_2-N_1))
